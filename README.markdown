A simple Wikipedia search application with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. Uses the Wikipedia API to search for articles and display relevent article titles. Initially built as part of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification (though this project is no longer part of the curriculum).
